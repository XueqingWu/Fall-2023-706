This is the git template.

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to create a github template so that everytime we can create a new respository base on this template. The template includes devcontiner, README, requirement, gitignore, main file, test_main file. 

## Steps
1. I created a template based on professor Noah Gift's template by watching his o'Riley video. Then I made some slight changes on Makefile and requirements based on the potential softwares I will use in the future
2. Created a main file to include funcitons and code
3. Created a test_main file to test the main file

## Check Formats and Test Errors
